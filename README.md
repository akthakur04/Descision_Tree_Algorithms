# Descision_Tree_Algorithms
Decision tree algorithms applied on various data sets on various datasets
A decision tree is a supervised Machine Learning algorithm which looks like an inverted tree ,where in each parent node represent a prediture variable
the link between the nodes represents a decision 
And each leaf node represents an outcome(response variable)
